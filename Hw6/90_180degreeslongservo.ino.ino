 90 x 15 = 1350 
 //90 is the degrees and the position of the servo, times the delay milliseconds. So 90 x 15 = 1350, at 90 degrees, the servo can travel 1350 milliseconds


 180 x 15 = 2700
 // 180 degrees is the position of the Servo. 180 x 15 = 2700. At 180 degree position with a 15 millisecond delay, the servo can travel 2700 milliseconds
